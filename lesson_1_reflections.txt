Version control seems like it will save 
tons of time keeping track of everything
I think it is really cool


2: How could having easy access to the entire 
history of a file make you a more efficient 
programmer in the long term?

You can go back and look at what worked when, 
and you can see the difference from when you have 
changed it. 

3: What do you think are the pros and cons of 
manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions 
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: you are in control and you can make as 
many or as few as you prefer. You also can name 
and keep track of them the way you would like.
Cons: that you could loose track of what you are
doing and forget to commit. 

4: Why do you think some version control systems, 
like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because some projects include multiple files that 
work together.

5: How can you use the commands git log and git 
diff to view the history of files?

if you compare two consecutive commits then you can 
what was done for that commit. Then you can retrace 
your steps until you figure out what you are looking for.
