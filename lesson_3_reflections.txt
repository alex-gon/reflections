When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I think that it might good to use a remote repository so you can more easily and 
quickly share with others on github.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I think that sometimes you may not want a pull from every commit because
    sometimes it takes a lot of commits to acomplish one thing. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A clone is a copy of an entire repository. A branch is a peice of a repository
    that has a specific commit history. A fork is a virtual copy of a repository 
    through github giving a link back to the original creator of that repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    so you can see how different it is since it was last pulled or pushed
